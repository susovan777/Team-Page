## Checklist
• Each object in the team array has 5 properties 
    ► id - unique for each team array object
    ► fullName - Name of the team member
    ► jobTitle - Job Title of the team member
    ► bio - Bio of the team member
    avatar - image avatar for the team member
• The section with the id = “content” is selected under which the cards will be added.
• The function generateCard() takes in 5 parameters as described in the index.js file and returns an HTML element
• It uses another helper function called getImageElement(src, alt) which takes in two parameters - src which is the image src and the alt for the image (you can use the alt as the team member’s name)
    ► The getImageElement() function sets the attributes src, alt, height, and width for the img element it creates.
    ► Set the height and width as 100
    ► Return the img element
• Write a generateCardArray(data) function to return an array with card elements generated by the generateCard() function one by one by looping throught the team array.
• Finally loop through this new array generated with the generateCardArray(data) function which takes in the team array as argument and adds the HTML elements to the content.
• The final output for console.log(content) should look like the one given below.
